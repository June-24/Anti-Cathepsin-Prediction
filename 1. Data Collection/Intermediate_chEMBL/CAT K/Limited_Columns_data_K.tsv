The assay was initiated by addition of substrate Z-Phe-Arg-aminomethylcoumarin ('Z-F-R-AMC' Bacchem) and the final assay conditions were 1.5 nM cathepsin K, 50 uM Z-F-R-AMC, 150 mM sodium acetate pH 5.5, 2.5 mM EDTA (Omnipure), 2.5 mM DTT (EMD), 0.01% BRIJ 35 (Sigma), and 4.0% DMSO (Acros). Test compounds were serially diluted with DMSO and water to include a final concentration range of 10 uM to 10 pM. The reaction was monitored fluorometrically for 5 minutes at 25C. using black 96-well Corning 3686 assay microplates with a Thermo Fluoroskan Ascent FL microplate reader.

Activation times were optimized and varied between 35 and 150 minutes. Cathepsin K was preincubated with test compounds at various concentrations for 5 minutes at 25C. The assay was initiated by addition of substrate Z-Phe-Arg-aminomethylcoumarin ('Z-F-R-AMC' Bacchem) and the final assay conditions were 1.5 nM cathepsin K, 50 uM Z-F-R-AMC, 150 mM sodium acetate pH 5.5, 2.5 mM EDTA (Omnipure), 2.5 mM DTT (EMD), 0.01% BRIJ 35 (Sigma), and 4.0% DMSO (Acros).
