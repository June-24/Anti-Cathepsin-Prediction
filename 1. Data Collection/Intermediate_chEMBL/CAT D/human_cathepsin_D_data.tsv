The fluorescent substrate cathepsin D and cathepsin E kinetic assays were performed at room temperature in 384-well microtiter plates (black with clear flat bottom, non binding surface plates from Corning) in a final volume of 51 ul. The test compounds were serially diluted in DMSO (15 concentrations, 1/3 dilution steps) and 1 ul of diluted compounds were mixed for 10 min with 40 ul of cathepsin D (from human liver, Calbiochem) diluted in assay buffer (100 mM sodium acetate, 0.05% BSA, pH 5.5; final concentration: 200 nM) or with 40 ul of recombinant human cathepsin E (R&D Systems) diluted in assay buffer (100 mM sodium acetate, 0.05% BSA, pH 4.5; final concentration: 0.01 nM). After addition of 10 ul of the cathepsin D substrate WTSVLMAAPC-MR121 diluted in cathepsin D assay buffer (final concentration: 300 nM) or 10 ul of the cathepsin E substrate MR121-CKLVFFAEDW diluted in cathepsin E assay buffer (final concentration: 300 nM), the plates were strongly shaken for 2 minutes. The enzymatic reaction was followed in a plate: vision reader (Perkin Elmer) (excitation wavelength: 630 nm; emission: 695 nm) for at least 30 minutes in a kinetic measurement detecting an increase of MR121 fluorescence during the reaction time.

Cleavage of the peptidic substrate by cathepsin D causes an increase in the fluorescence intensity. In order to determine the efficacy of substances, the time-dependent increase in the fluorescence intensity in the presence of the substance was compared with the time-dependent increase in fluorescence in the absence of substances. The reference substance used was pepstatin A (Sigma-Aldrich). The substrate used was MCAGKPILFFRLK(Dnp)d-R-NH2 (Enzo Life Sciences, Lorrach). The enzyme employed was cathepsin D isolated from the human liver (Sigma-Aldrich) in a final concentration of 1.4 nM. The test was carried out in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer, 1.25% (v/v) of DMSO, 0.25% (w/v) of Chaps, pH 5.5. 2 ul of each substance solution with serially diluted substance concentration were added to in each case 4 ul of cathepsin D solution and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The reaction was started by addition of 2 ul of substrate solution (final concentration 5 uM). After carrying out a starting-point fluorescence measurement (excitation wavelength 340 nm/emission wavelength 450 nm) using an Envision multilabel reader (Perkin Elmer), the reaction was incubated at room temperature for 60 min. The amount of peptide fragment cleaved off during the reaction time was subsequently measured by determination of the increase in the fluorescence intensity at 450 nm (excitation wavelength 340 nm).

The enzymatic inhibition activity assays were determined using the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. The assays were performed in a 384-well plate format. The recombinant human BACE-1 enzyme (R&D Systems, catalog#931-AS) was diluted to 20 ng/μL in assay buffer (100 mM sodium acetate pH 4.0), 10 point 1:3 serial dilutions of compound in DMSO were preincubated with the enzyme for 15 min at room temperature. The concentration of Cathepsin D was 20 ng/μL, and 1 ng/μL of Cathepsin E was used. CatD and CatE were activated by incubation in assay buffer (0.1 M NaOAc, 0.2 M NaCl, pH 3.5) at room temperature for 30 min. Subsequently, the rhBACE-1 substrate (R&D Systems, catalog# ES004), the Cathepsin D and Cathepsin E substrate (R&D Systems, Catalog # ES001) were added accordingly to final concentration

Cleavage of the peptidic substrate by cathepsin D causes an increase in the fluorescence intensity. In order to determine the efficacy of substances, the time-dependent increase in the fluorescence intensity in the presence of the substance was compared with the time-dependent increase in fluorescence in the absence of substances. The reference substance used was pepstatin A (Sigma-Aldrich). The substrate used was MCAGKPILFFRLK(Dnp)d-R-NH2 (Enzo Life Sciences, Lorrach). The enzyme employed was cathepsin D isolated from the human liver (Sigma-Aldrich) in a final concentration of 1.4 nM. The test was carried out in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer, 1.25% (v/v) of DMSO, 0.25% (w/v) of Chaps, pH 5.5. 2 ul of each substance solution with serially diluted substance concentration were added to in each case 4 ul of cathepsin D solution and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The reaction was started by addition of 2 ul of substrate solution (final concentration 5 uM). After carrying out a starting-point fluorescence measurement (excitation wavelength 340 nm/emission wavelength 450 nm) using an Envision multilabel reader (Perkin Elmer), the reaction was incubated at room temperature for 60 min. The amount of peptide fragment cleaved off during the reaction time was subsequently measured by determination of the increase in the fluorescence intensity at 450 nm (excitation wavelength 340 nm).

Cleavage of the peptidic substrate by cathepsin D causes an increase in the fluorescence intensity. In order to determine the efficacy of substances, the time-dependent increase in the fluorescence intensity in the presence of the substance was compared with the time-dependent increase in fluorescence in the absence of substances. The reference substance used was pepstatin A (Sigma-Aldrich). The substrate used was MCAGKPILFFRLK(Dnp)d-R-NH2 (Enzo Life Sciences, Lorrach). The enzyme employed was cathepsin D isolated from the human liver (Sigma-Aldrich) in a final concentration of 1.4 nM. The test was carried out in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer, 1.25% (v/v) of DMSO, 0.25% (w/v) of Chaps, pH 5.5. 2 ul of each substance solution with serially diluted substance concentration were added to in each case 4 ul of cathepsin D solution and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The reaction was started by addition of 2 ul of substrate solution (final concentration 5 uM). After carrying out a starting-point fluorescence measurement (excitation wavelength 340 nm/emission wavelength 450 nm) using an Envision multilabel reader (Perkin Elmer), the reaction was incubated at room temperature for 60 min. The amount of peptide fragment cleaved off during the reaction time was subsequently measured by determination of the increase in the fluorescence intensity at 450 nm (excitation wavelength 340 nm).
