Substrate (20 μM): Z-Val-Val-Arg-AMC, except for Cat K which uses Z-Leu-Arg-AMC (both from Bachem).  Z=Benzyloxycarbonyl.  AMC=7-Amino-4-Methyl-Coumarin.  DTT=dithiothreitol.  Final volume: 100 μL.  Excitation 360 nm, Emission 465 nm.Enzyme is added to the substance dilutions in 96-well microtitre plates and the reaction is started with substrate.
